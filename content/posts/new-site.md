I decided to move my site over from tumblr to something a little nicer to work with. Tumblr is definitely one of the major reasons I post pretty infrequently as I really don't like working with it at all.

So I've got a slick new site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and let me tell you something - it's a **lot** nicer to work with. I tried a few static site generators, primarily [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and just really enjoyed working with Huge mainly because it's insanely fast - seriously you never realize how slow your static site generator is until you use Hugo. It's the best.

So with a new fun tool to work with and a bit more time on my hands - I'm down to three subjects this semester - hopefully you'll be seeing some actual frequent posting from me.

Enjoy the new site!

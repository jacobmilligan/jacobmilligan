My name's Jacob Milligan and I'm a Computer Science student at Swinburne University.

In my programming life I spend most of my time with game development, graphics programming, and full stack web (node and react).

In my regular life I make music as [Son King](https://soundcloud.com/sonking) and, while I'm not a professional photographer anymore, do the occasional photography session here and there which will inevitably end up in a post or two on this website.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, my email is [jacobpmilligan@gmail.com](mailto:jacobpmilligan@gmail.com).

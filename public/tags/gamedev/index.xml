      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m by no means a super experienced graphics, gameplay, or engine programmer. In fact, until 2016 the only game-related projects I&amp;rsquo;d worked on were for Uni or were toy programs. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I have worked on a lot of toy projects but most of them were scrapped after the initial interest wore off.
However, in 2016, in the middle of my first year of Uni I got really into C++ and low-level programming in general and, figuring I&amp;rsquo;d pair that with my love of games I decided to start work on a big, proper project - a game built on a custom engine called Skyrocket made from scratch.</description>

      <description>Fractals are cool! They’re indispensable for procedural generation - things like clouds, heightmaps, moisture maps etc.
They can make things like this:
With an accompanying heightmap (This is actually Simplex Noise from my current project):
Unfortunately they can be pretty difficult to wrap your head around when getting started, there are a bunch of often-mentioned algorithms and techniques used to generate this stuff - Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise, Value Noise being a few, and they all have their pros and cons (value noise looks real bad though, so it’s mostly cons and latticing).</description>

      <description>Fractals are cool! They’re indispensable for procedural generation - things like clouds, heightmaps, moisture maps etc.
They can make things like this:
With an accompanying heightmap (This is actually Simplex Noise from my current project):
Unfortunately they can be pretty difficult to wrap your head around when getting started, there are a bunch of often-mentioned algorithms and techniques used to generate this stuff - Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise, Value Noise being a few, and they all have their pros and cons (value noise looks real bad though, so it’s mostly cons and latticing).</description>

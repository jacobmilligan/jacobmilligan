<p>I&rsquo;m by no means an experienced graphics, gameplay, or engine programmer. In fact, until 2016 the only game-related projects I&rsquo;d worked on were for Uni or were toy programs - nothing serious. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have worked on <strong>a lot</strong> of toy projects but most of them were scrapped after the initial interest wore off.</p>

<p>However, at the end of my first year of Uni I got <em>really</em> into C++ and low-level programming in general and, figuring I&rsquo;d pair that love with my love of games and work on a big, solid project - a game built on a custom engine made from scratch. I wanted to do it truly from scratch, no big dependencies - meaning no SDL for windowing and input, no GLM for maths, no Intel TBB for task scheduling - and release a game with it once I&rsquo;d finished.</p>

<h1 id="first-some-background">First, some background</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s insane and masochistic. We all know the only way to release a game is to use UE4, Unity, or GameMaker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ndash; <em>Someone on /r/gamedev, 2018. Probably</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, to be honest some days I really just want to fire up Unity or UE4 and actually start making a game and not have to worry about memory alignment issues, <code>- (void)ReallyAnnoyingObjectiveCMethodToTypeThatHas50Parameters</code>, deriving and testing linear algebra stuff, or <code>std::atomic</code> for the day . But thats only sometimes and I feel like the rewards for taking this path are huge. In fact, there are three big reasons I think that, at least for me, doing it like this is the only way forward:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>I want to be heaps better at programming</strong> and writing a game engine from scratch touches an enormous variety of areas of Computer Science and presents countless obscure architectural, algorithmic, and data structure problems, platform craziness, and general C++ language weirdness (because all of them have quirks - although C++ is definitely the quirkiest) that <em>force</em> you to get better at programming and software engineering in general.</li>
<li><strong>I want to be better at managing large projects</strong>  - time management, complexity management/minimisation, and workflow management are all really important parts of writing software, and because game engines are so complex the development of one (especially from scratch) requires tight discipline in regards to all of those areas in order to actually produce something and not get distracted or overwhelmed every five minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Making a game with your own engine is more fun</strong>. Sometimes. If you built every last line of the engine yourself, you know <em>all</em> the quirks and you can add features without waiting or remove stuff you hate. You can make it as lightweight or complex as you want and at the end of the day you won&rsquo;t have to consult the docs every time you want to do something because you <em>wrote</em> the docs. That being said, you only have yourself to blame when the engine sucks so this last point is a bit take it or leave it for many people.</li>
</ol>

<p>So while I want to release something, that&rsquo;s not the end goal of this project - it&rsquo;s a byproduct. The end goal is to learn a lot and improve as many skills as possible in the mean time and hopefully contribute a project to the Open-Source ether that people will get some use out of.</p>

<p>This post is going to be the first of hopefully a long series, maybe more of a stream of thought (or stream of screams into the void), about the process of making a game and engine from scratch. Something I wish I&rsquo;d had when I started this process, especially for someone with very little experience, was some material from someone who was doing the same thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since realised that people in computer science, and especially gamedev, rarely write solid first-hand learning accounts - everyone seems to want to appear an expert even though they only just learned the thing they learned - nobody wants to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; or &ldquo;I did this wrong&rdquo; or &ldquo;I did it like this for x, y, z reason and I fully acknowledge there are probably a million better ways to do it&rdquo; even though they&rsquo;re usually the most accurate statements. I write a whole post on this issue later at some stage as I truly think it alienates a lot of good people. So here it is - a first-hand learning series about a guy trying to make a game engine from scratch, having very little experience doing so, and making a tonne of mistakes along the way.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that a lot of the posts to come will be <em>retrospectives</em> as I&rsquo;ve completed a large chunk of the platform abstraction, render backend, and core libraries but once those posts have caught up, it&rsquo;ll all be &lsquo;live&rsquo; from then on out!</p>

<h1 id="part-0-so-uh-where-do-i-start">Part 0 - So&hellip; Uh&hellip; Where do I start?</h1>

<p>It&rsquo;s so easy when starting big projects to feel paralyzed by the tasks you&rsquo;ve set out before you. Maybe you&rsquo;ve drawn up a list of features and requirements and are just staring at them going &ldquo;Cool, so now how do I <em>do</em> all this&rdquo;, or maybe you don&rsquo;t know enough about the projects goals to even draw up requirements properly.</p>

<p>For me, I&rsquo;d drawn up a trello list of requirements and didn&rsquo;t know how to proceed from there at all as I&rsquo;d never made an engine before and knew little about graphics API&rsquo;s and engine architecture. So how do you work out where to start and how to implement everything if you don&rsquo;t know much about the problem domain?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>You research</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I researched a lot. Luckily I&rsquo;d made a few crummy games with SFML and SDL and had made my way through the excellent <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">Learn OpenGL tutorials</a> in order to get a crash course in graphics API&rsquo;s.</p>
